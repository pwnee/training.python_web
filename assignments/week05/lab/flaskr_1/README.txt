Chris,

I had hoped to get this up and running in CherryPy this weekend but I didn't have much luck
One of the issues I ran into was trying to get some sort of db up and running on my windows box.  
But then I was concerned about that transferring from the windows machine to the VM.  That and it seems like a pain to get databases set up in general on Windows.  I was able to get the hello world for cp up and running, but then when I tried to get my TDD going, I couldn't figure out how to get a db to play nice, nor the syntax for CherryPy when I tried to follow the steps for Flask I got kinda lost.  Not everything translated.
